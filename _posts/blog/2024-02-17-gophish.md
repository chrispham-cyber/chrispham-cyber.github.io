### WHAT IS GOPHISH?

![](/assets/img/blog/gophish/intro.png)
Gophish is a powerful, open-source phishing simulation tool that allows security professionals and organizations to create, manage, and track phishing campaigns. It provides a user-friendly interface for designing phishing emails and landing pages, making it accessible even for those with limited technical expertise. Gophish is primarily used for:

**Security Awareness Training**: Educating employees about the dangers of phishing and how to recognize suspicious emails.

**Penetration Testing**: Assessing an organization’s vulnerability to phishing attacks by simulating real-world scenarios.

**Data Collection**: Gathering metrics on how many users clicked on links or submitted sensitive information.
