This blog for anyone who love hacking and don't know how to gather information and scan vulnerability.

## Why does it matter?

> Vulnerability scanning helps you find and fix security weaknesses in your systems **before attackers** can exploit them. It protects sensitive data, prevents cyberattacks, ensures **compliance** with regulations, reduces **financial and legal risks**, and helps maintain a strong **security posture**. Regular scanning ensures you're **prepared** and **proactive** in the fight against evolving cyber threats.


## Nikto
Nikto is an open-source web server scanner used to identify vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and other security issues in web servers. It performs comprehensive tests against web servers. Nikto looks for:

| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Server Info Disclosure**       | Web server version, banner info (e.g., Apache 2.4.29 on Ubuntu)     |
| **Outdated Software**            | Known vulnerable versions of Apache, PHP, OpenSSL, etc.             |
| **Dangerous Files**              | `/phpinfo.php`, `/test/`, `/backup/`, `/admin/`, etc.               |
| **Default Files/Configs**        | Leftover install files like `index.html`, `readme`, or test pages   |
| **Misconfigurations**            | Directory listing enabled, HTTP methods allowed (e.g., PUT, TRACE)  |
| **Insecure Scripts**             | Scripts with known vulnerabilities (e.g., `cgi-bin/test-cgi`)       |
| **SSL/TLS Checks**               | Weak ciphers or expired/self-signed certificates (if HTTPS is used) |
| **Authentication Bypass Issues** | Weak or missing access controls on admin paths                      |

## Nmap
If you prefer GUI more than CLI, you can use `Zenmap`.

Nmap is the main command-line tool for Network Mapper (Nmap), which is used to discover hosts, services, and vulnerabilities on a network.

```bash

- sV: determine service/version info, 
- sC: Nmap will run a set of scripts that are considered `default` or safe to execute. These scripts generally check for common services, misconfigurations, and vulnerabilities on the target.

We can see which ports are opened, hostname, workgroup, operating system, etc...

We notice that port 445 (SMB) is opened, so let try to scan its vulnerability.

We can notice its vulnerability right here

```
smb-vuln-ms17-010: 
|   VULNERABLE:
|   Remote Code Execution vulnerability in Microsoft SMBv1 servers (ms17-010)
|     State: VULNERABLE
|     IDs:  CVE:CVE-2017-0143
|     Risk factor: HIGH
|       A critical remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft SMBv1
|        servers (ms17-010).
```

So what can we do with these information?

## Metaploit

Now we will use `metaploits` to exploit this machine.

```bash
msfconsole
```

Search for `CVE-2017-0143`

Next step, we need to set our `RHOSTs` as target's IP and `LHOST` as our IP. Example: `set rhosts 0.0.0.0`

After setting up, we exploit and get into the target's system (type `run` or `exploit` to execute).

Happy hacking!
