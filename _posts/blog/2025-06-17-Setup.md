I am writing this blog for anyone who love hacking and don't know how to set up a virtual machine lab. 

We have 2 options: VMware and VirtualBox. 

Unfortunately, VirtualBox does not support on Macbook, so we will use VMware instead.

## Download VMware

Go to [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/products/desktop-hypervisor/workstation-and-fusion), click on `Download`

Register your account, after login, we will see `Free Software`, click on it.

Search for `VMware` and click on `VMware Fusion`, download the latest version.

## Set up Kali Linux machine

Next, we need to download image of Kali Linux, go to [ISO](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-installer-images)

After downloading VMware, open it and add `New`

Choose `Install from disc or image`

Add the `.iso` file we just downloaded

Choose the latest version of Debian

Choose `Install` means we will install in terminal

After choosing language, location, and keymap, we will name our host.

```bash
---(heland@kali)-[/]
```

`heland` is username, `kali` is hostname

then next until finish.

### Setting

After installing kali, we need to custom machine to have well performance.

- **CPU:** More cores = better multitasking; Faster CPU = faster tool performance and lower lag.
- **RAM:** Running multiple programs at once; Smooth experience; Fast switching between apps and tools
- **HDD/SSD:** Booting Kali Linux quickly; Saving and loading large files; Installing and updating tools fast

| Component | Spec|
|-----------|-----|
| CPU | 4 cores |
| RAM | 4GB |
| HDD/SSD | 512GB |

Above is my recommendation.

> Remember to take a snapshot before playing around, It will save you lots of time, just imagine you did something wrong and broke down your machine, you don't need to install from nothing, just restore the last snapshot.
