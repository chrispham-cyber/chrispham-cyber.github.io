So you have decided to dive into cybersecurity? Maybe you have heard about ethical hacking, Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, or just want to break into tech in a fun and hands-on way.

Good news: You don’t need a degree or years of experience to get started. In fact, there are platforms out there made for people like you, places where you can learn by actually doing.

In this post, I’ll walk you through **5 amazing platforms** that helped me and thousands of others learn cybersecurity from scratch:

* [Hack The Box (HTB)](#hack-the-box-htb)
* [TryHackMe (THM)](#tryhackme-thm)
* [VulnHub](#vulnhub)
* [picoCTF](#picoctf)
* [SANS Holiday Hack Challenge](#sans-holiday-hack-challenge)


## [Hack The Box (HTB)](https://hackthebox.com)

**Best for:** Learning ethical hacking and penetration testing (Red Team)

Hack The Box is like a gym for hackers, full of challenges that simulate real world systems. You get to break into machines, escalate privileges, and learn how vulnerabilities work.

* Machines range from **easy to insane difficulty**
* No step-by-step help (great for learning by trial and error)
* Great if you’re preparing for certifications like **OSCP**

**Advice:** HTB might feel overwhelming at first. Start with “Starting Point” machines, they’re beginner friendly and walk you through the basics.

## [TryHackMe (THM)](https://tryhackme.com)

## [VulnHub](https://vulnhub.com)

**Best for:** Practicing on your own system, offline

VulnHub is a collection of downloadable vulnerable machines. You download them, run them in something like VirtualBox, and try to hack into them.

* No internet needed (great for practicing offline)

**Advice:** There’s no built in help or progress tracking, so it’s more suited for practicing what you’ve already learned.

## [picoCTF](https://picoctf.org)

**Best for:** Students and beginners who love puzzles

picoCTF is a **free cybersecurity game** created by Carnegie Mellon University. It’s built like a competition, with puzzles in areas like cryptography, reverse engineering, and web exploitation.

* Fun, puzzle style challenges
