### Bandit 

The Bandit wargame is aimed at absolute beginners. It will teach the basics needed to be able to play other wargames. It focuses on basic shell commands like

`ls, cd, cat, file, du, find, grep, sort, uniq, base64, strings, nc`.

### SOLUTION
#### [Level 0](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit0.html)

Connect to shell host using `ssh` with username `bandit0` and password `bandit0` and host `bandit.labs.overthewire.org`.

```bash
ssh -p 2220 bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org
```

After login, you will see the file `readme`, view content to get password: `???ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip???`

#### [Level 1](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit1.html)

Use password from bandit0 to login, you will see a file `-` can not view with normal command like `cat` or `strings`, use `more` instead. Password: `263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac????`

#### [Level 2](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit2.html)

You will see a file with special name `--spaces in this filename--`, use `<` or `--` or `./` to view content. Password: `MNk8KNH3Usiio41PRUEoDFPqfx????`

```bash
cat < "--spaces in this filename--"
cat -- "--spaces in this filename--"
cat "./--spaces in this filename--"
```
#### [Level 3](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit3.html)

Your task is to read hidden file's content. Use `ls -la` to display all files. Password: `2WmrDFRmJIq3IPxneAaMGhap0pF????`


#### [Level 4](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit4.html)

The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory.

List all file to see which file is human-readable.

```
file -- *

-file00: data
-file01: data
-file02: data
-file03: data
-file04: data
-file05: data
-file06: data
-file07: ASCII text
-file08: data
-file09: data
```

#### [Level 5](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit5.html)

Hint:

human-readable

1033 bytes in size

not executable

```bash
find . -size 1033c 2>/dev/null
```

-size 1033c: search for files that are exactly 1,033 bytes in size. The suffix c stands for characters (bytes).

2>/dev/null: This redirects standard error (stderr) to a special null device that discards all data.

#### [Level 6](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit6.html)

Hint

owned by user bandit7

owned by group bandit6

33 bytes in size

```bash
find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null
```

#### [Level 7](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit7.html)

```bash
grep millionth data.txt
```

#### [Level 8](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit8.html)

```bash
sort data.txt | uniq -u
```

sort data.txt: sorts all lines in the file alphabetically.

uniq -u: print unique

#### [Level 9](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit9.html)

```bash
strings data.txt | grep "=="
```

#### [Level 10](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit10.html)

```bash
echo “base64 string” | base64 -d

```

base64 -d: to decrypt base64 string

#### [Level 11](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit11.html)

where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions.

That means it's ROT13, use cyberchef or dcode to decrypt it.

#### [Level 12](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit12.html)

Use [List of file signatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures) to recognize the file type.

When we see the file's content, we know that it is a hexdump. Compress it and decrypt it. But first, we need to copy `data` to `tmp`

```bash
mktemp -d
```

It will give you a random temporary directory, change directory to it and copy `data`.

```bash
xxd -r data.txt compressed
hexdump compressed
```

We will see `1f 8b`, that means `Gzip`.

```bash
mv compressed data.gz
gunzip data.gz
```

Repeatedly decompress until you get the password!

`64 61 74 61` for `tar`, to decompress, `tar -xf`

`42 5A 68` for `bz2`, to decompress, `bzip2 -d`

#### [Level 13](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit13.html)

We have SSH key for bandit14, change mode for the key with `chmod 600 key`.

Login with `ssh -i key`

#### [Level 14](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit14.html)

The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30000 on localhost. Get the current user's password with

```bash
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
```

Connect localhost with `netcat`

```bash
nc localhost 30000
[password]
```

#### [Level 15](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit15.html)

The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30001 on localhost using SSL/TLS encryption.

`openssl s_client`: implementation of a simple client that connects to a server using SSL/TLS.

```bash
openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001
[password]
```

#### [Level 16](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit16.html)

Find open ports on localhost with `nmap`

```bash
nmap -sV localhost -p 31000-32000
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-12-20 03:23 UTC
Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
Host is up (0.00011s latency).
Not shown: 996 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
PORT      STATE SERVICE     VERSION
31046/tcp open  echo
31518/tcp open  ssl/echo
31691/tcp open  echo
31790/tcp open  ssl/unknown
31960/tcp open  echo
```
We will see 2 port `SSL`, but only one of them is sus, `31790 unknown`. But if we use the same technique in level 15, we will get `KEYUPDATE`. So we will add `-ign_eof`.

```bash
openssl s_client -ign_eof -connect localhost:31790
```

#### [Level 17](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit17.html)

See differences between 2 files with `diff`

#### [Level 18](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit18.html)

We can not use the password above for this level, look like someone has modified `.bashrc` to log us out when we log in with `SSH`.

```bash
ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 /bin/bash
```

`/bin/bash` spawn a bash shell

#### [Level 19](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit19.html)

```
ls -la
total 36

drwxr-xr-x   2 root     root      4096 Oct 14 09:26 .
drwxr-xr-x 150 root     root      4096 Oct 14 09:29 ..
-rwsr-x---   1 bandit20 bandit19 14884 Oct 14 09:26 bandit20-do
-rw-r--r--   1 root     root       220 Mar 31  2024 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r--   1 root     root      3851 Oct 14 09:19 .bashrc
-rw-r--r--   1 root     root       807 Mar 31  2024 .profile
```

We will see permission of `bandit20-do` is `-rwsr-x---`, which means it is a executable file. So let try to execute it.

```
./bandit20-do 
Run a command as another user.
  Example: ./bandit20-do whoami
```

So we will see how to use it now, `.bandit20-do [command]`

```bash
./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
```

#### [Level 20](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit20.html)

To send password, we will use the command below

```bash
echo -n 'password level 19' | nc -l -p 1234 &
```

`echo -n` prevents newline

`-l` listening

`&` to run in background

Now execute the file

```bash
./suconnect 1234
```
