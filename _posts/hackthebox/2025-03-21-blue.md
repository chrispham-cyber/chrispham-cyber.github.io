# Writeup
After scanning, we know how many ports are opened, hostname and operating system is running on.
![scan](assets/img/htb/blue/scan.png)

Using `smbclient -L {ip}` to list all SMB shares. 
![smb](assets/img/htb/blue/smb.png)

Search `CVE Windows 17` on Google, we can see the payload. Set `RHOSTS` as target's IP and `LHOST` as attacker's IP, then run.
![msf](assets/img/htb/blue/msf.png)

Using `Meteploits` for exploiting. Access to the target's machine, go to `Adminstrator` and get flag.
