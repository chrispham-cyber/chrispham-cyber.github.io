# Writeup
Scanning target and we get some open ports.
![](assets/img/htb/lame/1.png)

We can look at port `21 FTP`, we have `vsFTPd 2.3.4` and port `445 SMB`, we have `Samba 3.0.20-Debian`. Now try it with `Metaploits`.

We can not exploit by using FTP, so we should try SMB.

So we get in the target's machine, let get the flag at `root` and `makis` directories.
