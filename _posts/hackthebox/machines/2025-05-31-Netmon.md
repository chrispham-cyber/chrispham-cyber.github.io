Netmon is an easy difficulty Windows box with simple enumeration and exploitation. PRTG is running, and an FTP server with anonymous access allows reading of PRTG Network Monitor configuration files. The version of PRTG is vulnerable to RCE which can be exploited to gain a SYSTEM shell.

We can see Port 21 (FTP), and 80 (HTTP - PRTG Network Monitor) are opened.

### User Flag
Login FTP with anonymous and no password.

We can get user's flag at /Users/Public/user.txt

### Root Flag
We will search for `PRTG` location on Google, and we will get `C:\ProgramData\Paessler\PRTG Network Monitor`

Here we have 3 configuaration files, get them all and read thourgh.

We will see credential in plain text.

```
<!-- User: prtgadmin -->
    PrTg@dmin2018
```

Access to port 80, look at the bottom of the website, we can see the version `18.1.37`, let search for its CVE.

After we have its CVE, let go to metaploit and search for cve, set up rhost, credential, lhost and then run, we can get the flag from the path `Users/Administrator/Desktop/root.txt `
