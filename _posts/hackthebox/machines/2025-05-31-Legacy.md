# Machine Information

Legacy is a fairly straightforward beginner-level machine which demonstrates the potential security risks of SMB on Windows. Only one publicly available exploit is required to obtain administrator access.

```

We can see that we have 2 RCE vulnerabilities (2008 and 2017), now we search it in metaploit.


### Exploit

```
search cve-2008-4250
```

Modify `RHOST` and `LHOST` then `run`.

After getting in the target's machine, use `getuid` to see who we are.

### User & Root Flag

Get user's flag at `C:\Documents and Settings\john\Desktop\user.txt`

Get user's flag at `C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt`
