### CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION
Khalid has just logged onto a host that he and his team use as a testing host for many different purposes. It’s off their corporate network but has access to lots of resources on the network. The host is used as a dumping ground for a lot of people at the company, but it’s very useful, so no one has raised any issues. Little does Khalid know; the machine has been compromised and company information that should not have been on there has now been stolen – it’s up to you to figure out what has happened and what data has been taken.

### SOLUTION 

**At a glance, what protocol seems to be suspect in this attack?**

At a glance, we can see lots of packets with `DNS` protocol.

DNS

**There seems to be a lot of traffic between our host and another, what is the IP address of the suspect host?**

Go to `Statistics > IPv4 > All addresses > Sort Count colunm`.

<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
192.168.157.145

**What is the first command the attacker sends to the client?**

We totally can guess that, when attackers have access to target's machine, the first thing the attackers do is checking the current user that is logged in.

Filter `ip.dst == 192.168.157.145` and follow first packet, copy all of the content from that packet and paste in `CyberChef` > From Hex.

**What is the version of the DNS tunneling tool the attacker is using?**

We can get the flag from the above decrypted hex.

Or we can download tool to help us analyze easier: [DNScat](https://github.com/josemlwdf/DNScat-Decoder)

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
0.07
</details>

**The attackers attempts to rename the tool they accidentally left on the clients host. What do they name it to?**

The target's machine is WindowOS, so they use `cmd` or `powershell`, so `ren` for rename.

```bash
grep -ri 'ren ' dnscat_dump.txt
```

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
win_installer.exe
</details>

**The attacker attempts to enumerate the users cloud storage. How many files do they locate in their cloud storage directory?**

Cloud storage means `OneDrive`.

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
0
</details>

**What is the full location of the PII file that was stolen?**

Read the log slowly, and carefully =))

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
C:\Users\test\Documents\client data optimisation\user details.csv
</details>

**Exactly how many customer PII records were stolen?**

Columns in database
```
ID,job,company,ssn,residence,current_location,blood_group,website,username,name,sex,address,mail,birthdate
```

scroll down to the end of the log and we can see the ID of the last user. Because ID starts from 0, so we need to add 1 more in the flag.
