### CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION
Khalid has just logged onto a host that he and his team use as a testing host for many different purposes. It’s off their corporate network but has access to lots of resources on the network. The host is used as a dumping ground for a lot of people at the company, but it’s very useful, so no one has raised any issues. Little does Khalid know; the machine has been compromised and company information that should not have been on there has now been stolen – it’s up to you to figure out what has happened and what data has been taken.
