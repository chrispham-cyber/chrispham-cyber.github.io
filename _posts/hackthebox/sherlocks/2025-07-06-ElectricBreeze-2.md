**What is the password to unlock the zip?**

> zip2john turns a password-protected ZIP file into a hash format that John the Ripper can crack.

```bash
zip2john 4bcedac20a75e8f8833f4725adfc87577c32990c3783bf6c743f14599a176c37.zip > hash
```

Now crack it with `rockyou` wordlist.

```bash
john hash --wordlist=$ROCKU
```

**What type of encryption is used?**

`SecretKeySpec`

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
AES
</details>

**What cipher mode is used to encrypt the credentials?**
<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
ECB
</details>

**What is the key?**
<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
56, 50, 97, 100, 52, 50, 99, 50, 102, 100, 101, 56, 55, 52, 99, 53, 54, 101, 101, 50, 49, 52, 48, 55, 101, 57, 48, 57, 48, 52, 97, 97
</details>

**What is the value of the key after decoding?**

Look at this part
```
SecretKeySpec secretKey = new SecretKeySpec(new byte[]{
    56, 50, 97, 100, 52, 50, 99, 50,
