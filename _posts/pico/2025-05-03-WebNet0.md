### CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION

### SOLUTION 
#### WebNet0
Open wireshark, go to the tab: `Edit > Preferences > Protocols > TLS` then add `RSA key list`

We will see some new `HTTP` packets, follow them and we have the flag.

There is also a diffrent way to solve this problem.
```bash
ssldump -r [pcap] -k [key] -d
```
We will see the output includes some HTTP packets, use `grep` to search for `picoCTF`

---

#### WebNet1
Just open `pcap` file, follow the `HTTP` file and search for `picoCTF`.

**Notice:** The flag below is fake!
