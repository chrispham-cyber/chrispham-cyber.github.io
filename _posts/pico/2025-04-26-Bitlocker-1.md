### CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION
![](assets/img/pico/Bitlocker-1/1.png)

### SOLUTION - Bitlock-1
First, we need to crack bitlock password using `bitlocker2john` to get hash, and crack hash by `john`
```bash
bitlocker2john -i bitlocker-1.dd > hash.txt
john hash.txt -w=[wordlist]
```
> Make a directory to store the dislocker-file located inside the bitlocker.dd, a virtual file that represents the decrypted contents of the bitlocker encrypted volume.

```bash
mkdir disc
```
> Afterwards, use the dislocker tool to unlock the bitlocker encrypted drive. The password “jacqueline” is specified with -u argument. The output is then, saved to the “dislocker” directory.

```bash
sudo dislocker -v bitlocker-1.dd -ujacqueline disc 
```
> Upon unlocking the bitlocker drive we can see that the dislocker-file is present. We now need to mount this file in our machine.

```bash
mkdir mnt
```

> The command above mounts the unencrypted/unlocked bitlocker file to the “mnt” directory. The -o loop is used to tell the computer to treat the regular file (dislocker-file) as if it were a physical disk drive. This allows us to access all the folders and files inside it, just like a USB drive or HDD. The concept is similar to inserting a CD into your laptop.

```bash
sudo mount -o loop disc/dislocker-file mnt 
```

### SOLUTION - Bitlock-2
As we can see, they provide us RAM dump file. We need to unzip it first, then search for the flag.
```bash
strings memdump.mem | grep picoCTF 
```
