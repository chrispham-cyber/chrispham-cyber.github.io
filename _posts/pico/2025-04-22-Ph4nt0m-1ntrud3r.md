### CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION
![](assets/img/pico/Ph4nt0m-1ntrud3r/1.png)

### SOLUTION
#### Manual
We open `pcap` file with `Wireshark`, we can notice that there are some things look like `Base64` strings, and some of them have same length.

We search `tcp.len == 12` to filter all packets with length is 12 and from the hint, we sort them by time. Copy all of the data to a file and decode it with `base64 -d`

#### Auto
We can also do this
```bash
tshark -r myNetworkTraffic.pcap -Y "tcp.len==12 || tcp.len==4" -T fields -e frame.time -e tcp.segment_data | sort -k4 | awk '{print $6}' | xxd -p -r | base64 -d
```
