### CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION
![](assets/img/pico/head-dump/1.png)

### SOLUTION
They will give us a link to `PicoCTF News`
![](assets/img/pico/head-dump/2.png)

By guessing, click all of the hashtags, we are redirected to `api-docs` page, and we can easily notice `/headump` at the bottom.

Now click on it > `Try it out` > `Execute` and we download the file.

Search for the flag in file.
```bash
grep pico [file]
```
