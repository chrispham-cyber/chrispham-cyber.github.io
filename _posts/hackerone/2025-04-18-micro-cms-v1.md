### CHALLENGE HINT

### Flag0
After creating new page, we can notice our `ID` on URL. Hmmm, something wrong here, we can click on 2 provided pages and notice that their `ID` are `1` and `2`, but our new page got `ID=7`, so we need to run from 3 to 6 to find anything interesting.

After analyzing, we can see `ID=5` is `Forbidden`. Now try to access it but with edit page.

### Flag1
We can get the first flag. Beside that, we can our `ID` is passed directly to URL, we should try `SQL injection` here by add `'` to URL.

### Flag2
We can use hint from `Flag2`, try some `XSS` on title, and then go back to `HOME`
```bash
<script>alert(1)(/script)
```

### Flag3
Go to `edit page` we can notice the last line `Markdown is supported, but scripts are not` and from the hint of the last flag, we try some `XSS` but not the `<script` this time.
```bash
<img src=x onerror=alert(2)>
```
We can see the alert pop up, but still don't see any flag. Right click to view source and we get the last flag.
